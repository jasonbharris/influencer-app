            I have been working for myself now for six months now and I am glad that I made the decision
            to start. Now I have control of every aspect of my life, my time, my income and my total enjoyment
            of life itself.  I no longer have to be limited to what I can make and give my own self a raise
            whenever I desire to have one, I am no longer making someone else rich when I can make myself
            rich, I no longer have to ask for time off; I can come and go when I please.

            I am a disabled Army veteran who served for twenty-two years. I loved everything about my job
            because of the different places that I was able to live while I was in the military. I made some
            good friends along the way also, friends that I still associate with to this day. I have worked
            at a few different organizations after getting out of the military, but found out that I was not
            cut out for working outside of the military. Plus, I had to go to doctor appointments frequently so
            therefore I had to inform my employer of my absents, therefore having to miss out on work a lot of times
            and made my earnings that much less.

            we are engaged to be married. Any way, she had gotten injurred at work and could not work because of her hips
            being so bad that she now has to walk on a walker because of the way she had fell while on duty as she worked at a
            elderly home care facility and was preventing one of her clients from falling and ended up hurting herself.
